    Eve Demo (Secured)
    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

    This is a fork of Eve Demo (https://github.com/nicolaiarocci/eve-demo)
    intended to demonstrate how a Eve API can be secured by means of
    Flask-Sentinel.

    For demonstration purposes, besides protecting a couple API endpoints
    with a BearerToken class instance, we are also adding a static html
    endpoint an protecting with via decorator.
